# DSS-09-DevelopingDataProducts-Week4-PeerAssignment
Peer-graded assignment of week 4 of Course 09 - Developing Data Products of the Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera

## Description of the assignment

**Your Shiny Application**

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to 
get started using your application.  
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server  
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box  
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github  

The application must include the following:

1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)  
2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R  
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations  
4. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.  
5. The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.  

The Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from 
the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R datasets packages. 
Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. 
You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 
Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

**Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation**

OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. 
You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.  

Here's what you need:

1. 5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter  
2. Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs  
3. A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box  

Your presentation must satisfy the following  

1. It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter  
2. It must be 5 pages  
3. It must be hosted on github or Rpubs  
4. It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document  

## Results
The app is deployed on shinyapps.io. It is publicly available and can be started by using the following link:

The pitch is also made publicly available on Rpubs:
